<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;">Dear Elieen,<br> Thank you fro recent application to join us at the Univetsity Of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by on in the following sections.</p>
<h4>Starting dates</h4>
<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;"> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us<br>
 better if you could start at the beginning Of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
<ul> <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li> <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li> <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li> </ul>
<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;">Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;">You can find more information about on our <a href="https://universityofawesome.edu">website</a>.</p>
<h4>Subjects of study</h4>
<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;">At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall<br>
somewhere in the realm Of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
the kind Of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, Of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order Of priority:</p>
<ol> <li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H1203.)</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 300C (8600, when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104)</li>
<li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li> </ol>
<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;">So please can you provide more information on each Of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
research to take, required staff and Other resources, and anything else you think we'd <br>need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
<p styel ="font size=100%;"style="text-align:left;">Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. TO answer your question,<br>
my favourite dances are as follows , with definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polynesian chicken dance: </li>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p></div>
<li>Icelandic brownian shuffle: </li>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>modern styles such as Twerking.</p></div>
<li>Arctic robot dance:</li>
<div style="margin-top: 10px;"> <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on, however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
because they were really cold. For more of my research,</p></div>
</ul>
